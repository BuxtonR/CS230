Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, requested a multi-platform web game based on their Android mobile application, Draw it or Lose it. In the game, multiple teams compete against each other by guessing a puzzle from the application’s image library.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When constructing this design document, I did particularly well in evaluating different operating platforms. It was easier for me to compare and contrast the benefits and disadvantages for the operating platforms against the development requirements.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

What I found most helpful about the process was figuring out the design constraints of the application according to the client’s requirements. By doing so, it prevented potential errors in the game and gave me an idea of where to start.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of the software design document, I would choose to edit the requirements section. While I was able to construct a general idea of the client’s needs, I think a more comprehensive and detailed report would have been very helpful.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpret the user’s needs as the main priority of the project. Their needs guided and shaped the overall software design. It is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing because it allows me, as the developer, to include features specifically customized for them.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software applications?

When designing software, my approach is heavily dependent on client requirements and needs. I like to focus on creating a seamless and smooth user interface that is design intuitive. In the future my strategy would be to conduct user research for better design construction. In addition, I would also gather user feedback on prototypes to incorporate in refining the software.
